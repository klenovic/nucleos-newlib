/* Super block table.  The root file system and every mounted file system
 * has an entry here.  The entry holds information about the sizes of the bit
 * maps and inodes.  The s_ninodes field gives the number of inodes available
 * for files and directories, including the root directory.  Inode 0 is 
 * on the disk, but not used.  Thus s_ninodes = 4 means that 5 bits will be
 * used in the bit map, bit 0, which is always 1 and not used, and bits 1-4
 * for files and directories.  The disk layout is:
 *
 *    Item        # blocks
 *    boot block      1
 *    super block     1    (offset 1kB)
 *    inode map     s_imap_blocks
 *    zone map      s_zmap_blocks
 *    inodes        (s_ninodes + 'inodes per block' - 1)/'inodes per block'
 *    unused        whatever is needed to fill out the current zone
 *    data zones    (s_zones - s_firstdatazone) << s_log_zone_size
 *
 * A minix3_super_block slot is free if s_dev == NO_DEV.
